The Action Starter is a [GitHub repository template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) that provides a minimalistic boilerplate to kickstart your [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) project.
Use this template to initialize your project with predefined file structures and preconfigured settings recommended for a GitHub Action project.
